- NPM:
  NPM is an acronym for Node Package Manager. It is a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to install, update, and manage external libraries and tools used in JavaScript projects.

It allows developers to:

- Add external libraries to a project (e.g., React, Axios, Tailwind)
- Manage and track the versions of packages used
- Run custom scripts for development, building, and testing..

```bash
  NPM makes it easy to manage project dependencies and automate tasks through simple commands like npm install or npm run dev.
```

- Package.json

Package.json is a very important file created when you initialize a JavaScript project using npm.
It serves as the configuration file for the entire project and it contains:

- Project details: name, version, type..
- Dependencies: libraries needed for the project to run
- DevDependencies: tools needed only during development
- Scripts: commands you can run using npm run...

It also helps to keep the project organized and allows anyone who downloads your project to install everything using just: **npm i/npm install**

- Vite
  Vite is a modern build tool and development server designed to make React and other frontend frameworks faster and smoother to use. It is lightweight in nature.
